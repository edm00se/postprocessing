I've added my personal Handbrake JSON settings file and Comskip ini settings file.

follow config_steps.txt for package, symlink, environment configuration

use post.sh as post-processing script option in media server


some issues with processing files that have a . in the filename, like "S.W.A.T."

ideally would like to add something from Project X to cleanup mpeg2 ts stream data prior to the file going to handbrake.
